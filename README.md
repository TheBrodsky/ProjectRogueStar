# ProjectRogueStar

My first foray into game development. Not being actively developed anymore and likely never will. Scope was way too high and lack of co-developers makes it less rewarding.

The concept was for a skill system built on top of a sufficiently advanced skill "language" to create a lot of emergent behavior, similar to Noita, Bioprototype, and other "spellcrafting" games. The underlying language is the "action chain," which consists of Actions and Triggers that chain together, allowing Actions later in the chain to inherit certain stats from prior Actions. Most importantly, the "origin" point (in space) of an Action is passed on to any object or effect created by an Action, allowing the player to create spells with more advanced behavior.
