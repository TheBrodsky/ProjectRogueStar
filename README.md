# To-Do
* Adopt GDScript styling guidelines. Notable examples:
	- 2 lines between functions
	- filenames use snake_case
	- prepend "_" to private functions and variables and to methods which must be overriden
	- reorder scripts according to "Code Order" section of GDScript style guide
* expand base Enemy class to include common properties and methods. Export those so that the same script can be attached to different enemies (instead of inheriting)
* create enemy spawner
